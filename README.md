# Arduino-Led-Panel

## Description
A project for a diy led panel with a single strip led of 147 leds disposed like below exemple.
I used the `Adafruit_NeoPixel` library to control the differents leds. The code for the rainbow wave was picked in the strandtest exemple of the library.

The "manonProgram" folder contains a special version of the program for a friend.

## Exemples
### Piece of connection of the leds

```

^ v ^ v ^ v ^
^ v ^ v ^ v ^
^ > ^ > ^ > ^
```
